# Angular Integration with MSAL

This repository shows the key components of a working integration using Angular 17 and MSAL to access and use Microsoft Entra accounts.
This is a work in progress, we will complete the examples and update to new Angular and MSAL versions as soon as we can!
We will also add some step by steps instructions on how to complete a successful integration.

To quickly check the key components that you would need in your Angular client application: 
- [app.config component](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/blob/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/app.config.ts)
- [Msal components](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/tree/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/msal)

Feel free to branch or use any part of the code.

Don't forget to:
- Setup your Microsoft Entra parameters in the file [msal-config](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/blob/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/msal/msal-config.ts)
- Execute the client in https (Microsoft Entra is not allowing to register http urls)

And finally, If you're up for contributing...
