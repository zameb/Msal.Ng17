# Angular Integration with MSAL

This repository showcases the key components of a functional integration using Angular 17 and MSAL to access and utilize Microsoft Entra accounts. 
It's a work in progress as we aim to address the following issue: https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/6719#issuecomment-1950231908.

We will be completing the examples and updating to the latest Angular and MSAL versions as soon as possible! 
Additionally, we plan to provide step-by-step instructions on achieving a successful integration.

For a quick overview of the key components needed in your Angular client application, check:
- [app.config component](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/blob/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/app.config.ts)
- [Msal components](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/tree/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/msal)
-- Specially [msal-config](https://github.com/zameb/Msal.Ng17/blob/main/Quipu.AngularClient/src/app/msal/msal-config.ts)

(Tested with Angular 17.2.1)

Feel free to branch or use any part of the code.

And lastly, if you'd like to support my work...
